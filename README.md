# Venice Boats Classification

**Goal:** Implement a ML algorithm to differentiate between 24 different classes (23 different types of boats, and 1 class for water)

## Libraries Used

this repo runs on python 3.6.4(x64), and pip (18.1). You can install the python requirements with  
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

```text
    git clone https://github.com/elsheikh21/venice-boats-classification
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

- Downloaded from ([here](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~labrococo/MAR/classification.htm))

- 4774 training images, 1969 testing images

  - the dataset was altered, to get a number of matching classes between the training and testing classes. So we end up with 19 classes. &nbsp;

  - Note folders removed names are hard coded in the code for that purpose
